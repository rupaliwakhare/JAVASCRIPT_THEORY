Operaters in js


In JavaScript, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values (operands). They’re the tools that let you do math, compare values, assign data, and more.



➕ Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math:

Operator	                       Description	                           Example

+	                                Addition	                          5 + 2 → 7
-	                                Subtraction	                          5 - 2 → 3
*	                              Multiplication                          5 * 2 → 10
/                               	Division	                          5 / 2 → 2.5
%	                             Modulus (remainder)	                  5 % 2 → 1
**	                              Exponentiation	                      2 ** 3 → 8
++	                               Increment	                             x++
--	                               Decrement	                             x--






📝 Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:

Operator	                         Example	                          Same As
=	                                 x = 5                                  —
+=                              	x += 2                             	x = x + 2
-=	                                x -= 2	                            x = x - 2
*=	                                x *= 2	                            x = x * 2
/=	                                x /= 2	                            x = x / 2
%=	                                x %= 2	                            x = x % 2





🔍 Comparison Operators
Used to compare values:

Operator                    	Description                         	Example
==                         	Equal to (loose)	                    5 == '5' → true
===	                        Equal value and type	                5 === '5' → false
!=	                        Not equal (loose)	                    5 != '5' → false
!==	                        Not equal value or type              	5 !== '5' → true
>	                        Greater than	                        5 > 3 → true
<	                        Less than	                            5 < 3 → false
>=	                       Greater than or equal	                5 >= 5 → true
<=	                       Less than or equal                    	5 <= 4 → false




🧠 Logical Operators
Used to combine or invert conditions:

Operator	            Description	                Example
&&	                   Logical AND	            true && false → false
`		`	         Logical OR	`true		       false→true`
!	L                ogical NOT	            !      true → false








🧵 String Operators
+ is also used to concatenate strings: "Hello" + " World" → "Hello World"





🎯 Ternary Operator
A shorthand for if...else:

javascript
let result = (score > 50) ? "Pass" : "Fail";








🧪 Type Operators
typeof: Returns the type of a variable → typeof 42 → "number"

instanceof: Checks if an object is an instance of a class → arr instanceof Array → true
