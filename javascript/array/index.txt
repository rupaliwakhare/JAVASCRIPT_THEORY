what is array ?

In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. It‚Äôs like a list or collection where each item has a numbered position called an index, starting from 0.

üß± How to Create an Array
javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
You can also use the Array constructor:

javascript
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
üîç Accessing Elements
javascript

console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"
console.log(fruits[2]); // "mango"





üõ†Ô∏è Common Array Methods

Method                                    	Description	                                       Example
push()                                  	Adds to the end	                                  fruits.push("orange")
pop()	                                   Removes from the end	                                    fruits.pop()
shift()                                	Removes from the beginning	                             fruits.shift()
unshift()	                              Adds to the beginning	                                 fruits.unshift("kiwi")
length	                             Returns number of elements	                                 fruits.length
includes()	                           Checks if value exists                              	fruits.includes("banana")
indexOf()	                           Finds index of a value	                                fruits.indexOf("mango")
join()	                           Converts array to string                                   	fruits.join(", ")
slice()	                             Extracts a portion                                        	fruits.slice(1, 3)
splice()	                         Adds/removes elements	                                    fruits.splice(1, 1, "pear")



what is indexing ?

In JavaScript, array indexing refers to how you access elements inside an array using their position number, called an index.
üî¢ How Indexing Works
Zero-based: The first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on.

You access elements using square brackets: array[index].


let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // "red"
console.log(colors[2]); // "blue"

üß† Key Points
If you try to access an index that doesn‚Äôt exist, you‚Äôll get undefined.

You can change values using indexing:

javascript
colors[1] = "yellow"; // changes "green" to "yellow"
Arrays in JS are dynamic, so you can add new elements by assigning to a new index:

javascript
colors[3] = "purple"; // adds a new element at index 3


üîç Finding Index of a Value: indexOf()
If you want to find the index of a specific value:

javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
let index = fruits.indexOf("banana"); // returns 1
If the value isn‚Äôt found, it returns -1




üß† Why Use Arrays?


Store and manage lists of data

Easily loop through items

Perform bulk operations like sorting, filtering, and mapping

Arrays are dynamic, meaning you can grow or shrink them as needed. Want to explore how to loop through arrays or use methods like map() and filter() for powerful transformations
