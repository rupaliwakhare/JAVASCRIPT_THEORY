In JavaScript, let is a keyword used to declare variables with block scope, introduced in ES6 (2015). It‚Äôs a modern alternative to var, offering more predictable behavior‚Äîespecially in loops and conditional blocks.

üß† Key Features of let
Block Scoped: Only accessible within the {} block where it's defined.

Reassignable: You can change its value later.

Not Hoisted Like var: It‚Äôs hoisted but not initialized, so accessing it before declaration throws a ReferenceError.

No Redeclaration: You can‚Äôt declare the same let variable twice in the same scope.

üß™ Example
javascript
let score = 10;
if (score > 5) {
  let message = "Great job!";
  console.log(message); // ‚úÖ Works
}


console.log(message); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: message is not defined
