n JavaScript, const is a keyword used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. It was introduced in ES6 (2015) and is ideal for values that should remain constant throughout the program.

🔐 Key Characteristics of const
Block-scoped: Like let, it’s only accessible within the {} block where it’s defined.

Must be initialized: You must assign a value when declaring it.

No reassignment: Once assigned, you can’t reassign the variable to a new value.

Mutable objects: If the value is an object or array, its contents can still be changed.

🧪 Example
javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
PI = 3.14; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

const user = { name: "Aarav" };
user.name = "Riya"; // ✅ Allowed: modifying object property
📌 When to Use const
For values that should never change (e.g., configuration settings, fixed numbers).

To make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

As a default choice—use let only when you know the value will change.
