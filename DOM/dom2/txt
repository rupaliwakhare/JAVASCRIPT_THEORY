ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in DOM Level 2?
DOM Level 2, released by the W3C in the early 2000s, expanded the DOM API with several key modules:

1. Events Module
Introduced the standard event model with addEventListener() and removeEventListener().

Enabled event capturing and bubbling, giving developers more control over how events propagate.

2. Traversal and Range
Added methods to navigate the DOM tree more efficiently.

Example: NodeIterator and TreeWalker let you loop through nodes in a structured way.

Range objects allowed you to select and manipulate fragments of the document.

3. Style Module
Gave access to CSS styles via JavaScript.

Example: element.style.color = "blue" or getComputedStyle(element).

4. Views Module
Introduced the concept of document views, like defaultView, which refers to the window object.

5. Core Enhancements
Improved support for namespaces and XML documents.

More robust DOM manipulation methods.

ðŸ§ª Example: DOM2 Event Handling
html
<button id="clickMe">Click Me</button>
<script>
  const btn = document.getElementById("clickMe");
  btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("DOM Level 2 event triggered!");
  });
</script>
