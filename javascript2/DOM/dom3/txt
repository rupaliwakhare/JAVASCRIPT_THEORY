DOM Level 3 was a significant evolution of the Document Object Model, building on the foundations of DOM Levels 1 and 2. It introduced more powerful and flexible tools for developers to interact with web documentsâ€”especially XML and HTML.



ðŸ§  Key Features of DOM Level 3
1. XPath Support
Introduced the ability to use XPath expressions to navigate XML documents.

Example: document.evaluate() lets you query nodes using XPath syntax.

2. Load and Save Module
Enabled loading and saving of documents via the DOM.

Useful for working with XML files in client-side or server-side environments.

3. Keyboard Events
Added support for keyboard event handling, like keydown, keypress, and keyup.

Provided more detailed information about key inputs (e.g., key codes, modifiers).

4. Text and Range Enhancements
Improved handling of text nodes, whitespace, and character data.

Enhanced the Range interface for selecting and manipulating parts of a document.

5. Validation and Configuration
Introduced interfaces for document validation, especially for XML schemas.

Allowed configuration of DOM behavior using DOMConfiguration.

ðŸ§ª Example: XPath with DOM3
javascript
let result = document.evaluate(
  "//p[@class='highlight']",
  document,
  null,
  XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE,
  null
);

for (let i = 0; i < result.snapshotLength; i++) {
  console.log(result.snapshotItem(i).textContent);
}
